# Chappie the chatbot

I made this simple retrieval based AI chatbot name Chappie using Python and tkinter GUI. 
This chatbot app take text input from the user, process it and give instant pre-set response.
Response phrases are fetched from responses.json file.
The model is trained using patterns and tags data from training_data.csv file.
It matches the pattern of input text and predict the response.

####Here is the screenshot.
